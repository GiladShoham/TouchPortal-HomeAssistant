# TouchPortal-HomeAssistant
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) plugin for [Touch Portal](https://www.touch-portal.com/)

## Intro
This is an [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) plugin for [Touch Portal](https://www.touch-portal.com/).
It is inspired by a great similar project [TP-HomeAssistant](https://github.com/jaybz/TP-HomeAssistant).

So why a new plugin?
1. The original plugin doesn't supports mac/Linux at the moment, and I need those :)
2. The TouchPortalAPI used by the original project is not maintained anymore, so it will be hard to add new features there. see [this issue](https://github.com/jaybz/TP-HomeAssistant/issues/20) in the original project.
